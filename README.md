# Eloquent Javascript Exercises but with Typescript

-   Book can be found [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net) (the exercises are at the end of the chapter). Src folders will follow the following structure: `src/chapter-6` for the Chapter 6 exercises
-   You can test this with `npm test`
-   If you want, delete the implementation and try to do it yourself (In the future I may add an empty branch with just the tests)
-   If you like the book I can't recommend it enough. Support the author purchasing it!

## Instructions

-   Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:rubenmate/EloquentJS-but-with-TS.git`
-   `cd EloquentJS-but-with-TS`
-   `npm install`
-   You can now run the tests `npm test`
